## Architectural Rules (Do Not Violate)

- V1 core task behavior must never change.
- Firestore schema changes must remain backward compatible.
- All new fields must be optional.
- Theme system must remain presentation-only.
- No heavy third-party libraries without strong justification.
- Avoid introducing global state unless necessary.
- Performance must not degrade as features increase.
- Any feature added must include a clear rollback path.
- Analytics must compute client-side from already-fetched data.
- No destructive migration of Firestore documents.

---

## Data Migration Policy

When new fields are added:

- Must be optional.
- Existing tasks must continue working unchanged.

Default values:

```
isRecurringDaily = false
priority = "medium"
```

Rules:

- No forced rewriting of existing documents.
- No background batch rewriting.
- No breaking schema changes.

---

## Performance Guardrails

- No heavy chart libraries (Chart.js, Recharts, etc.).
- Heatmap must be custom lightweight grid.
- Avoid unnecessary re-renders.
- Avoid expensive Firestore reads.
- No polling.
- Memoize analytics calculations.
- Avoid animation-heavy libraries.

---

## Theme System Contract

Theme behavior must follow strict rules.

- Theme controlled via single theme state.
- CSS variables drive all theme differences.
- No inline conditional styling chaos.

Adding a new theme requires:

- Only new CSS variable definitions.
- Minimal component logic changes.

Persistence:

```
localStorage key: ded_theme
```

Theme must load before hydration to prevent UI flicker.

---

- Soft inner glow

#### Typography

- Clean futuristic font
- Slight letter spacing

#### Header HUD

- Tech divider lines
- Section caps
- Subtle animated accent bar

#### Clock Enhancement

- 24h format
- Milliseconds
- Date + timezone

### Constraints

- Must reuse existing theme architecture.
- No Firestore changes.
- No performance degradation.

---

## V2.2 – Productivity Expansion [COMPLETED]

Structured productivity intelligence without AI.

### Recurring Tasks (Daily Only)

**Field:**

```ts
isRecurringDaily?: boolean
```

**Behavior:**

If enabled and task is completed:

- Auto-create next-day instance.
- Prevent duplicate instances.
- Preserve full completion history.

**Scope limitations:**

- No weekly recurrence.
- No custom schedules.

### Priority System

**Field:**

```ts
priority?: "low" | "medium" | "high"
```

**Default:** `"medium"`

Task sorting order:

1. Priority (high → low)
2. Created date

### Basic Analytics Panel

Toggleable analytics panel including:

- Completion rate (7 days)
- Current streak
- Tag distribution bars
- 30-day heatmap grid

**Constraints:** No heavy chart libraries.

### Manual Task Ordering

Users can drag pending tasks to set a persistent custom order. Until the first drag, tasks sort automatically by priority.

**Schema field:**

```ts
orderIndex?: number  // optional; absence = automatic priority sort
```

**Two-mode sort for pending tasks:**

| Condition | Sort order |
|-----------|-----------|
| No pending task has `orderIndex` | priority DESC → createdAt ASC |
| Any pending task has `orderIndex` | orderIndex ASC → createdAt as tiebreaker |

Check: `hasManualOrder = pending tasks.some(t => t.orderIndex !== undefined)`

Priority order: `high > medium > low`

**Completed tasks:** unaffected; sorted by completion date DESC.

**New task creation:**
- If `hasManualOrder = false`: no `orderIndex` assigned; task slots into priority sort automatically.
- If `hasManualOrder = true`: `orderIndex = max(existing orderIndex) + 1`; task appends at the bottom of the manual list.

**Drag reordering:**
- First drag activates manual ordering for the session.
- Assigns sequential `0, 1, 2…` indices to the entire pending list after drop.
- Only tasks whose `orderIndex` value changed are written to Firestore (minimal writes).
- Desktop: full drag-and-drop via dnd-kit PointerSensor.
- Mobile: `orderIndex` persists via Firestore sync (mobile drag disabled to preserve scroll behaviour).

**Backward compatible:** field is optional; tasks without `orderIndex` are unaffected until a drag occurs.

## V2.4 – Mobile Native UX Layer [PLANNED]

Goal: Make the mobile experience behave like a native iPhone productivity app.

Desktop experience remains unchanged.

### Mobile Layout

When screen width < 768px, replace Kanban layout with tab navigation.

**Tabs:**

- Pending
- Completed
- Insights

Only one list visible at a time.

### Bottom Navigation

Mobile must use a fixed bottom navigation bar.

**Layout:**

```
Pending | Completed | Insights
```

Navigation switches views without page reload.

### Mobile Task Interaction

Dragging across long vertical lists is not mobile-friendly.

**Primary completion method:** Tap completion button

**Optional gesture support:**

- Swipe right → Complete task
- Swipe left → Edit / Archive / Delete

Must reuse existing task logic.

### Floating Add Task Button

Add mobile floating action button.

**Position:** Bottom-right corner

Tap opens task creation modal.

### Task Card Mobile Improvements

- Minimum height: 60px
- Larger tap targets
- Increased spacing
- Smooth completion animation

### Focus Mode Mobile Compatibility

Focus Mode must:

- Display active task clearly
- Allow completion

## V2.4 – Mobile Native UX Layer [COMPLETED]

Goal: Make the mobile experience behave like a native iPhone productivity app.

Desktop experience remains unchanged.

### Mobile Layout

When screen width < 768px, replace Kanban layout with tab navigation.

**Tabs:**

- Pending
- Completed
- History (replaced Insights tab; Insight modal accessible via top-bar button)

Only one list visible at a time.

### Bottom Navigation

Mobile must use a fixed bottom navigation bar.

**Layout:**

```
Pending | Completed | History
```

Navigation switches views without page reload.

### Mobile Task Interaction

**Primary completion method:** Tap completion button

**Gesture support:**

- Swipe right → Complete task
- Swipe left → Edit / Archive / Delete

### Floating Add Task Button

Bottom-right corner. Tap opens task creation modal.

### Task Card Mobile Improvements

- Minimum height: 60px
- Larger tap targets
- Smooth completion animation

### Focus Mode Mobile Compatibility

Focus Mode hides nav and FAB when active.

### History View

- `/history` route (desktop) and "History" tab (mobile bottom nav)
- Completion history grouped by date (Today / Yesterday / date string)
- Derived client-side from existing `completionHistory[]` field
- No Firestore schema changes
- Pagination: 30 date-groups default, expandable in 30-group increments

### Constraints

- Desktop layout unchanged
- No Firestore schema changes
- No heavy gesture libraries
- Theme compatible

---

## V2.4.1 – Notes UX Improvements [COMPLETED]

Enhanced notes editing and reading experience inside `TaskModal`.

### Auto-Expanding Textarea (Desktop)

- Textarea grows vertically as user types
- Range: 80px minimum → 300px maximum
- Beyond 300px: vertical scrollbar appears inside the textarea
- Implementation: `resizeNote()` sets `el.style.height` to `scrollHeight` clamped to range; called via `useEffect` on `noteText` change
- No scroll during normal typing; `overflow-y: hidden` below max, `auto` above

### Expand / Collapse Notes (Daily Notes History)

- Each historical note shows a 4-line collapsed preview (`max-height: 5.5rem`)
- "Expand notes" / "Collapse" toggle per note entry
- Animation: `max-height` CSS transition (0.25s ease) between `5.5rem` and `600px`
- Toggle only shown when note qualifies: length > 200 chars OR > 3 newlines
- State: `Set<number>` of expanded indices — no re-renders of other entries

### Mobile Fullscreen Notes Modal

- On mobile (<768px), the notes textarea is replaced by a tap-target button
- Tapping opens a `z-[60]` fixed fullscreen overlay (above task modal at `z-50`)
- Overlay: task title header + full scrollable textarea + single "Save note" footer
- Auto-expand also applies inside the mobile overlay textarea
- Closing with "Done" without saving discards unsaved changes; "Save note" persists

### No Schema or Firestore Changes

- Reuses existing `dailyNotes[]` field on Task
- No new fields added

---

## V2.4.2 – Manual Ordering + History Notes [COMPLETED]

Two targeted UX improvements with no breaking changes.

### Manual Task Ordering

See documentation under V2.2 Productivity Expansion → Manual Task Ordering.

### Notes Visibility in History View

Each history entry now displays task notes inline.

**History card fields shown:**

- Task title
- Tags (badge)
- Priority (if non-medium)
- Completion date
- Notes preview (3-line clamp of most recent note)

**Expand/Collapse (desktop):**

- "Expand notes" link appears when note length > 150 chars, contains newlines, or task has notes on multiple days.
- Expanded state shows all `dailyNotes` sorted newest-first, with date headers.
- "Collapse" link returns to preview.

**Mobile fullscreen modal:**

- On mobile (< 768px), tapping "View notes" opens a `z-[70]` fixed fullscreen overlay.
- Overlay shows all notes sorted newest-first with date headers.
- "Close" button in header dismisses the modal.

**Constraints:**

- History remains read-only — no editing from History view.
- No Firestore schema changes — reuses existing `dailyNotes[]` field.
- No heavy libraries.
- Compatible with all themes.
